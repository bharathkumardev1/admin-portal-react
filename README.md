# Admin Portal (React + TypeScript)

A role-based admin portal built with React + TypeScript demonstrating:

- Authentication & role-based access (Admin / User)
- Protected routes
- Table-based management UI
- Basic API integration patterns

## Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- React Router

## Project Goals

This project illustrates how I structure admin UIs:

- Clear separation of pages, components, and context
- Role-based guards around routes
- Simple, readable TypeScript components

The implementation is intentionally minimal and can be extended with a real backend or mock API.
